    "\n",
    "1. Switch back to IDLE's Python Shell, type `import arcpy`, and then press Enter.\n",
    "2. Return to the BufferRoads.py script window, on the first line, type `import arcpy`, and then press Enter.\n",

    "4. Type `arcpy.`. A drop-down list of arcpy functions should appear after a few seconds. Type `e` to jump to the functions starting with \"e\".\n",

    "2. Type `bufferList = []` and press Enter.\n",

    "This code will create a new, empty Python list.\n",

In this case, your feature classes are already stored in meters, so you could have provided the distance without the units. \n",
